/*
 Given a package with a weight limit - limit
 and an array (arr) of item weights, implement a function getIndicesOfItemWeights that finds two items who sum of weights equals the weight limit (limit).
 Your fucntion should return a pair [i,j] of the indicies of the items weights, orsers such that i>j.
 If such a pair doesn't exist, reutrn an empty array.

 Analize the time and space complexity
