# Prompt
you have 8 coins which are all the same weight, except for one which is slightly heavier than others (you don't know which one is heavier). You also have an old -style blanace, which allows you to weigh two piles of coins to see which one is heavier (or if they are of equal weight). What is the fewest number of weighings that you can make which will tell you which coin is heavier one?
# Answer:
2 times weighings,
  +  first: weigh 3 coins against 3 coins
  +  if one group is heavier, take 1 coin weigh again another coin
  +  if these two group are equal, weigh 2 left coins against each other
